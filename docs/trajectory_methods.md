# Trajectory Methods

## Reference source

- **Dynverse**[@dynverse]: 45 methods filtered from 70 methods before 2019 years. Output results of them can be classfied to 7 wrapper. Paper, github reository, document are available.
- **Github Reporsitory**[@sc_pseudotime_github]: A repository keeps track of the latest trajectory infernce methods in real-time. Related topics such as upstream opertion(data imputation, dimsional reduction), donstream analysis(GRN inference, trajectory alignment) and reviews are also included.

## Implementation order (TODO List)

- [ ] Dynverse represtive methods for 7 basic wrapper:
  - [x] `Direct`: PAGA
  - [x] `Linear`: Component 1(baseline)
  - [ ] `Cycle`: Angle(baseline)
  - [ ] `Prob`: SCUBA
  - [ ] `Cluster`: GrandPrix
  - [ ] `Proj`: MST(baseline)
  - [ ]  `Cell`: Monocle2
- [ ] `Velocity` wrapper:
      - [ ] Strategy from `Velocity` wrapper to `Direct` wrapper.
      - [ ] represtive method scVelo.
- [ ] For other methods, the higher the citation count of the paper, the higher the implementation order(need statistics from google scholar).

> The work integrate trajectory methods from the issue area continuously.
